          ECG is commonly used to diagnose various heart conditions, such as
          arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), myocardial infarction (heart
          attack), ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart), heart valve
          disorders, and congenital heart defects. The ECG waveform provides

          a heart attack. It provides real-time information about any changes in
          the heart's electrical activity, allowing healthcare professionals to
